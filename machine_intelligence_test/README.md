This essay was a group assignment and part of the University of Bath's Artificial Intelligence MSc. Within 1000 words +/- 10%, our task was to devise an intelligence test that would allow the tester to differentiate between human and machine intelligence in an intelligence domain. We took a holistic approach to the problem and decided to try and capture broad intelligence, leaning heavily on psychology literature to provide a psychological justification for the structure and content of the test.
