Both assignments were for the Introduction to NLP module, with the preparation report worth 30% of the module and the opinion miner implementation 70%. This was a significant and open ended project, both very challenging and interesting. I scored 78% on the project preparation report, and 81% on the opinion miner implementation and report. The module leader commented that my implementation was one of the best they had seen and commended my effort.
