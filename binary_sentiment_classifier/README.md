This work implements a binary sentiment classifier as well as various feature extraction techniques using scikit-learn, and was created as part of a University of Bath Artificial Intelligence MSc assignment. This assignment was worth 50% of the module credits and I scored 89%. Task 2 required us to investigate improving the performance of the classifier by either experimenting with a new model or by experimenting with new feature extraction methods. I opted to explore the effect on classifier performance of various feature extraction methods, such as lemmatisation and n-grams.
